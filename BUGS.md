BUG-010: Search and Collection table columns resize on every page navigation
Status: Fixed
File(s): gui/search_tab.py:_render_page, gui/collection_tab.py:_render_coll_page, _on_missing_loaded
Reported: 2026-05-08
Fixed: 2026-05-08
Description: Column widths changed on every Prev/Next page click because `resizeColumnsToContents()` was called unconditionally on each render, sizing to the current page's content rather than a stable baseline.
Root cause: `resizeColumnsToContents()` in `_render_page()` and `_render_coll_page()` ran on every page change, not just on first load.
Fix: On first data load, all columns except Description are sized by content; Description defaults to 1400 px. Before each page render, current header widths (including any user drag-resizes) are snapshotted and then restored after the model reset that Qt uses to clear QHeaderView sections. Right-click on any column header opens a pixel-width entry dialog whose result is written into the stored widths immediately.

BUG-009: Results per page resets to 50 on every GUI startup
Status: Fixed
File(s): gui/setup_tab.py:_load_settings, _save_settings
Reported: 2026-05-08
Fixed: 2026-05-08
Description: The "Results per page" spinner on the Setup tab always reverted to 50 when the GUI was opened, regardless of the saved value.
Root cause: During `_load_settings`, each `setChecked`/`setValue` call on the checkboxes and `delay_spin` fired their connected signals (`stateChanged`, `valueChanged`), which triggered `_save_settings`. At that point `search_page_spin` had not yet been updated from the DB, so `_save_settings` wrote the widget default of 50 back to the `meta` table, overwriting the user's saved value before it could be applied.
Fix: Added a `_loading` boolean flag initialized to False in `__init__`. `_load_settings` sets it to True at entry and clears it in a `finally` block. `_save_settings` returns immediately when `_loading` is True. Also removed the now-redundant per-widget `blockSignals` calls on `search_page_spin`.

BUG-008: Search tab double-click opens 404 URL for LB numbers below 10000
Status: Fixed
File(s): gui/search_tab.py:_on_double_click
Reported: 2026-05-07
Fixed: 2026-05-07
Description: Double-clicking any non-LB-number column in the Search results table opened a URL like `LB-103.html` instead of `LB-00103.html`, producing a 404 for any LB number below 10000.
Root cause: f-string used bare `{lb}` integer formatting instead of `{lb:05d}`.
Fix: Changed to `f"...LB-{lb:05d}.html"` to match the site's 5-digit zero-padded naming convention.

BUG-007: status=missing search rows had no visual distinction
Status: Fixed
File(s): gui/search_tab.py:42
Reported: 2026-05-07
Fixed: 2026-05-07
Description: Entries inserted by "Mark sequential gaps as MISSING" appeared in search results as completely blank, uncoloured rows — identical to a broken or empty record.
Root cause: SearchModel.data() BackgroundRole only handled _owned rows; the status field returned from the API was never checked.
Fix: Added a status == "missing" check before the owned check; returns QColor("#FFFF99") so gap placeholders are clearly yellow.

BUG-006: Scraper section buttons too short, text clipped
Status: Fixed
File(s): gui/styles.py
Reported: 2026-05-07
Fixed: 2026-05-07
Description: Buttons in the scraper section QHBoxLayouts that shared a row with QLineEdit or QSpinBox widgets were height-constrained by the smaller widget, clipping the bottom of descender characters.
Root cause: No minimum height on QPushButton in the stylesheet; Qt layout shrank buttons to match adjacent inputs.
Fix: Added min-height: 26px to the QPushButton rule in build_stylesheet().

BUG-005: Scraper log [web]/[local] source tags sometimes missing or wrong
Status: Fixed
File(s): backend/scraper.py, gui/setup_tab.py
Reported: 2026-05-07
Fixed: 2026-05-07
Description: Some scraped entries appeared in the log with no `[web]` or `[local]` tag, and others showed the wrong tag. Entries that failed with an error were silently skipped in the log, causing the next entry to appear without a source tag.
Root cause: `current_lb` was set at the START of processing each entry, while `last_source` was set at the END. The GUI polled them together every second, pairing the source from the previously-completed entry with the LB number of the currently-being-processed entry. Error entries set `last_source = None`, which then propagated to the next logged line.
Fix: Added `last_lb` field to `_scrape_state` in `scraper.py`, updated alongside `last_source`/`last_action` after each entry completes. `_on_scrape_status` now logs `last_lb` (just completed) rather than `current_lb` (being processed), ensuring source tag always matches. Added explicit "Error scraping LB-X" log line for error entries.

BUG-004: force_scrape checkbox does not persist across restarts
Status: Fixed
File(s): backend/app.py:85, gui/setup_tab.py
Reported: 2026-05-07
Fixed: 2026-05-07
Description: The "Force re-scrape" checkbox was saved to meta as `force_scrape` but was never loaded back on startup because `GET /api/db/settings` did not include it in the returned keys list. The checkbox always defaulted to unchecked.
Root cause: `force_scrape` was missing from the hardcoded keys list in `backend/app.py`'s `db_settings` GET handler.
Fix: Added `force_scrape` (and `search_page_size`) to the keys list in `GET /api/db/settings`. `_load_settings` in setup_tab already read `data.get("force_scrape", "0")` so no GUI change was needed.

BUG-001: Scraper re-processes entries with download_files=False even when already scraped
Status: Fixed
File(s): backend/scraper.py:66-79
Reported: 2026-05-07
Fixed: 2026-05-07
Description: With force unchecked and scrape_attachments disabled, the scraper still re-scraped entries that were already in the DB. Entries with any `entry_files` rows (even with `downloaded=0`) were not skipped because the pending-count check always ran regardless of whether this scrape run intended to download files.
Root cause: The skip logic only returned `{skipped: True}` for an existing non-missing entry when `pending == 0`. If attachment records existed with `downloaded=0` (e.g. from a previous run with attachments on, or from a metadata-only scrape), the count was > 0 and the entry was not skipped.
Fix: Added `if not download_files: return {"skipped": True}` immediately after the missing-status check, so any entry already in the DB is skipped when this run has no intention of downloading files.

BUG-002: Externally sourced attachment files not recognized as downloaded — triggers repeat scrapes
Status: Fixed
File(s): backend/scraper.py:66-91
Reported: 2026-05-07
Fixed: 2026-05-07
Description: Files placed in `data/attachments/LB-XXXXX/` from an external source had `downloaded=0` in the DB (since the scraper never wrote them). The skip check counted these as pending and kept re-scraping those entries on every bulk scrape run.
Root cause: Skip logic only read the `downloaded` column from the DB; it never checked whether the file actually existed on disk.
Fix: Before evaluating the pending count, the skip check now iterates all `downloaded=0` records for the entry and updates them to `downloaded=1` if the file exists on disk. The pending count is then re-evaluated against the updated DB state.

BUG-003: force=True re-downloads attachment files already on disk when use_local_pages is enabled
Status: Fixed
File(s): backend/scraper.py:193-199
Reported: 2026-05-07
Fixed: 2026-05-07
Description: With both "Force re-scrape" and "Use local pages" checked, the scraper re-downloaded attachment files that were already present in `data/attachments/`, hitting the website unnecessarily.
Root cause: The attachment download loop's skip condition was `local_path.exists() and not force`. With `force=True`, this evaluated to False and the download always proceeded, ignoring the filesystem.
Fix: Changed condition to `local_path.exists() and (not force or use_local_pages)`. When `use_local_pages=True`, existing files are always preserved regardless of `force`.
