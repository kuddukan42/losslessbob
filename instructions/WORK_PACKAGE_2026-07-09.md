# WORK_PACKAGE_2026-07-09 — usage window through 7/12

Agreed plan (Fable 5 + tj, 2026-07-09). Refer here across sessions; strike rows as
they land. Move to `instructions/complete/` when the window closes.

---

## Decisions locked (2026-07-09)

1. **TapeMatch calibration is FROZEN.** Config stands at t_emb 0.75 / 5× cache /
   Rule D shipped. Close or defer TODO-203 (Tier C retrain — Tier C was rejected;
   recommend close) and TODO-204 (MrMsDTW probe — defer, artifacts retained).
   tj still suspects a breakthrough exists — parked, not forgotten: TODO-204 is the
   parked probe, and FABLE_TAPEMATCH_LISTENING_SIGNALS is the untapped signal class
   for a future window.
2. **Production runs start headless now** (machine compute, zero token cost); the
   TapeMatch screen adds monitoring when it lands — runs are not gated on GUI.
3. **Stretch goal = TapeMatch screen (TODO-170)**, not analysis catch-up.
4. **No external design phase** for the screen — text/ASCII sketch in session,
   tj approves, then build against gui_next patterns (tokens.ts, DetailPanel
   collapsible sections, shared EvidenceList per SPEC_INTEGRATION_NOTES F3/F4).
5. Concert ranker gets **no GUI this window** — ranking lands as Library
   badges/filters per FABLE_UNIFIED_RANKING; the CC_CONCERT_RANKER audio-scoring
   brain stays untouched until it has its own calibration window.

## Key numbers (measured 2026-07-09)

- Collection: 16,361 of 16,653 library entries local; 3,306 show dates have ≥2
  local recordings (tapematch-eligible).
- Runs done: 954 dates (1,103 run dirs) → **~2,350 dates remain** (weeks of
  machine compute — start early, let it churn).
- Analyses: 710 of 1,103 runs have analysis.md → 393 pending (biggest token sink;
  attack with triage script, not raw Claude batches).

## Timeline

| Slot | Work | Token cost | Closes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Today: unblock** | ✅ DONE 07-09: committed (39687e37 + 0c2d3e1e); crawl launched detached over 2,232 remaining dates — `tools/tapematch/crawl_start.sh` / `crawl_stop.sh` / `crawl_status.sh`, log at `data/tapematch/crawl.log` | Minimal | — |
| **Today: consolidate** | ✅ DONE 07-09: retired 4 specs to `complete/` (ADDON, FIXES, TAPEMATCH_PLAN, WEB_GUI_PLAN — all TODO-050..066 shipped), closed TODO-182 + TODO-203, deferred TODO-204. TODO-209 renumber DEFERRED past window — report reviewed, all 39 ids are archived-entry cosmetics needing manual cross-ref attribution | Low | 182, 203, backlog relief |
| **Today: triage script** | ✅ DONE 07-09: `tools/tapematch/triage_analysis.py` — AUTO/ESCALATE/SKIP classifier; first pass 395 pending → 11 auto-written, 329 escalated (210 are merges needing judgment), 55 incomplete; families synced (2,902, 0 errors). Run before every future `/tapematch-batch` | Low | analysis sink triaged |
| **Day 2: spec steps 1–3** | ✅ DONE 07-09 (commit 7a304abf): TAPER phase 1 (7,817 attributions: 2,643 confirmed / 5,174 propagated / 168 conflicts) + RANKING phase 2 (`show_picks` 15,204 picks / 4,031 dates; `POST /api/derived/recompute` SSE chain per F1) | Medium | 187 |
| **Day 3: spec step 4** | ✅ DONE 07-09 (sonnet agent, Fable-reviewed; uncommitted at close→committed): payload F4 fields, badges, 4 filter views, Picks tab + shared `EvidenceList` (F3); i18n 13 keys × 5 locales; tsc 0 errors, build clean. TODO-181+186 closed, TODO-212 opened (flat-lens remainder), RANKING spec retired to `complete/`. **tj eyeball verdict: pipeline works, badge DATA needs curation — TODO-213 (High) before trusting badges** | Medium-high | 186, 181 |
| **Day 3–4: spec step 5** | ✅ DONE 07-09 (commit 947845bd; 3 sonnet agents, Fable-reviewed): TAPER phase 2 — confirm/reject API (MASTER `taper_confirmations`, F2, recompute-equivalent immediate apply), GET single/list routes, confirmed-only Library pill + 2 filter views (review queue per §5), DetailPanel TaperZone (shared `EvidenceList` + tab-strip, curator-gated buttons). i18n 5 locales, 535 tests, tsc/build clean. TODO-213 example-collection NOT folded in (still needs tj's examples); phase 3 fingerprints → TODO-214 | Medium | 173 (192 was already closed) |
| **Stretch (budget permitting)** | ✅ DONE 07-10: LISTENING §1 pairs sync (`tapematch_pairs` 9,037 pairs / 1,094 dates, `similarity_pct` banded blend calibrated on 10,369 real pairs) + TapeMatch screen v1 (tj-approved sketch: date rail / similarity matrix / family chips / analysis.md viewer / crawl strip; read-only). 5 new API routes; 35 tests; i18n 5 locales; tsc+build clean. TODO-170 closed, TODO-215 opened (v2: corrections, run controls, deep-links) | High | 170 |
| **Fill (idle moments)** | TODO-210 + TODO-184 as small bounded tasks; a few `/tapematch-batch` batches only if triage script leaves ambiguous backlog | Low each | 210, 184 |

Parallel, zero-token: tj's curator review of the 265 census-flagged pairs
(TODO-201) while runs churn. — Update 07-09: batches 1+2 (128 pairs) reviewed,
83 FLIPs tj-approved and applied → `regression_set_v3.json`; remaining 136
duration-only pairs need a different method (partial/incomplete-set judgment).
Rescoring against v3 stays behind the calibration freeze.

---

## Phase 2 — surplus schedule (agreed 2026-07-10)

Original package fully landed by 07-10 (all slots incl. stretch). ~2.5 days of
window remain. Decisions (Fable 5 + tj, 2026-07-10):

1. **ONBOARDING P1→P3 pulled forward** into this window — the 07-09 deferral was
   a budget call and the budget didn't get spent. Spec step 7 prerequisites all
   exist (F1 recompute chain, taper confirmations in master, public repo for the
   sitedata release).
2. **TODO-213 (High) stays tj-gated and opportunistic**: tj unsure he can curate
   wrong-badge examples in the next 2 days. If examples arrive, tracing them
   preempts any slot below; otherwise TODO-213 carries past 7/12 as the top
   priority of the next window.
3. Escalated analysis backlog (329, of which 210 merge-judgment) remains a
   recognized token sink — untouched this window.

### Phase 2 timeline

| Slot | Work | Token cost | Closes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **7/10: finish spec step 6** | LISTENING §9 "tonight card" — consumes show_picks; do the M/D/YY→ISO `concert_date` reconciliation + `GET /api/picks?date=` here (parked for exactly this session per TODO-212). Ends `/gui-next-i18n` + `/gui-check`. **IN PROGRESS 07-10, session capped mid-slot — RESUME HERE.** Done+committed: BUG-246 detour (live `show_picks` found wiped → filed + defensively fixed in 73266f6b: empty-replace guard, path-mismatch direct write, queue re-init warning, 2 regression tests; data restored 15,204/4,031; bug stays open for the same-class audit of other db_path-taking writers: tapematch_sync, parse_lineage, taper_attribution, scrapers). **UNCOMMITTED + UNVERIFIED in working tree**: tonight-card backend — `_parse_concert_date_iso` + `concert_date_iso` population in concert_ranker/picks.py (year pivot 30, 'xx'→NULL), db.py schema+migration (+91 lines), app.py routes `GET /api/picks?date=` + `GET /api/picks/tonight` (?mmdd= override) (+42 lines), new tests/test_picks_tonight.py. Resume checklist: (1) `.venv/bin/python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`; (2) run `-m tools.compute_show_picks` to populate concert_date_iso in live DB + verify non-NULL count; (3) commit backend piece; (4) frontend: "Tonight in Dylan history" card in ScreenHome.tsx (fetch /api/picks/tonight, random candidate + shuffle button, hide when empty, NO deep-links — TODO-215; en.json keys only), then `/gui-next-i18n` + `/gui-check`; (5) commit, CHANGELOG, close step 6, note TODO-212's date-ISO item satisfied | Medium | step 6 complete |
| **7/10–11: ONBOARDING P1** | Site-data packaging — split export, `sitedata/github_release`, curator publishes first `sitedata-*` release to the public repo | Medium | spec §7 P1 |
| **7/11: ONBOARDING P2** | `sitedata/github_check` + `github_install`, `onboarding/status` endpoint — backend-only, verify via curl against the real P1 release | Medium | spec §7 P2 |
| **7/11–12: ONBOARDING P3** | First-run wizard + Home checklist card + Setup/Scraper copy changes + i18n; wizard "Done" fires the F1 recompute chain. Ends `/gui-next-i18n` + `/gui-check` | Medium-high | spec §7 P3 |
| **Small bounded (idle)** | TODO-210 implementation (investigation done 07-09): (a) family-sync conf bump for same-date abs_score-within-0.5 + same-grade shortlisted pairs; (b) "likely duplicate encode" review flag for same-scan-config metric_json-identical same-date pairs (never auto-merge) | Low | 210 |
| **If it fits** | ONBOARDING P4 (README rewrite) — spec says it can run any time; otherwise it rides with LISTENING §3+ per step 8 | Low | spec §7 P4 |

Preempt rule: tj wrong-badge examples → TODO-213 evidence_json tracing takes the
slot. Parallel, zero-token: crawl keeps churning (1,319 runs / 1,169 dates as of
07-10); check `crawl_status.sh` at session open.

## Explicitly deferred past 7/12

~~Onboarding (spec order puts it after step 5)~~ (pulled forward 07-10, see
Phase 2), LISTENING §3+, concert ranker scoring calibration, TODO-204 probe,
trading / sharing / web-GUI specs. TODO-213 joins this list if tj's examples
don't arrive by 7/12.

## Session hygiene

Each GUI slot ends with `/gui-next-i18n` + `/gui-check`; every code session ends
with `/session-close`. Spec work follows `SPEC_INTEGRATION_NOTES.md` §2 order and
its F1–F6 amendments.
