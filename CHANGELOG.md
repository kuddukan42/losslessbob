[2026-05-07] — Uniform fixed width on all four scraper action buttons

Changed

gui/setup_tab.py: Set all four scraper buttons (Scrape All Missing Entries, Stop Scraper, Scrape, Scrape Range) to a shared fixed width of 180px via a local constant `_SCRAPE_BTN_W`.

[2026-05-07] — Search filters, collection pagination/year filter, scraper grid and label fixes

Added

gui/search_tab.py: Three client-side filter checkboxes on the search bar — "Missing only" (status == 'missing'), "Owned only" (LB in My Collection), "Not owned" (LB not in My Collection). All three are AND-combined. Combining "Owned only" + "Not owned" yields an empty result. The owned filter re-renders automatically when `_OwnedWorker` finishes loading after a search.

gui/collection_tab.py: My Collection panel now auto-loads on startup (blank-screen fix). Added client-side pagination (Prev/Next, page label) driven by the shared Results per page setting. Added year dropdown filter populated from date_str of loaded entries. Text + year filters combined with AND; both reset to page 0 on change.

gui/main_window.py: Connected `setup_tab.search_page_size_changed` to `collection_tab.set_page_size` so the Results per page spinner also controls My Collection pagination.

Fixed

gui/search_tab.py: Double-click URL now formats LB number as 5-digit zero-padded (`LB-{lb:05d}.html`). Previously used bare integer, producing 404 for any LB below 10000.

gui/setup_tab.py: "Mark sequential gaps as MISSING" checkbox renamed to "Skip LB numbers with no checksum data" per user request. Grid restructured so Scrape All Missing Entries, Scrape (single), and Scrape Range buttons all occupy column 2 of the grid, making them the same width. Stop Scraper moved to column 3. Status label and fill-gaps checkbox now span columns 3–4.

[2026-05-07] — Yellow highlight for status=missing search rows; fixed scraper button layout and height clipping

Fixed

gui/search_tab.py: SearchModel.data() now returns a yellow QColor("#FFFF99") for the BackgroundRole when a row has status="missing", so gap-placeholder entries are visually distinct instead of appearing as blank uncoloured rows.

gui/setup_tab.py: Replaced three stacked QHBoxLayout rows in the Web Scraper section with a QGridLayout (4 columns: label, input, action button, extras). All three rows — bulk scrape, single entry, and range — now align in a clean grid with no visual overlap.

gui/styles.py: Added min-height: 20px to the QPushButton stylesheet rule so buttons in mixed-height rows are never clipped.

---

[2026-05-07] — Persistent scraper log file; fixed [web]/[local] source labels; error entries now logged

Added

gui/setup_tab.py: `_LOG_FILE = data/scraper.log` — every `_log()` call now appends to this file in addition to the in-app widget. Log file management row added to the Scraper Log group: a size label (auto-refreshed after each write and on startup), an "Open Log File" button, and a "Purge Log" button (truncates the file and clears the in-app widget after confirmation).

Fixed

backend/scraper.py: Added `last_lb` field to `_scrape_state`, set to the LB number that just finished processing (alongside `last_source`/`last_action`). Previously `current_lb` was set at the START of processing while `last_source` was set at the END, so the GUI polled them out of sync and log lines showed the wrong source tag.

gui/setup_tab.py: `_on_scrape_status` now logs `last_lb` (the just-completed entry) instead of `current_lb` (the one currently being processed). This ensures every log line's `[local]`/`[web]` tag correctly matches the logged LB number. Added an explicit "Error scraping LB-X" log line for error entries (previously silently dropped, causing the next entry to appear with no source tag).

---

[2026-05-07] — Scraper progress bar enlarged to show percentage text

Changed

gui/styles.py: Added `QProgressBar#scrapeProgress` override — 20 px tall with centered text. The global QProgressBar rule (6 px, no text) still applies to the thin activity bars in Verify and lbdir tabs.

gui/setup_tab.py: Set `objectName("scrapeProgress")` on the scraper progress bar so the taller QSS rule targets only that widget.

---

[2026-05-07] — Search tab pagination and configurable results-per-page setting

Changed

backend/db.py: `search_entries` default limit changed from 100 to `None` (unlimited). Caller can still pass an explicit limit. Search tab now fetches all matching entries and paginates client-side.

backend/app.py: `GET /api/db/settings` now returns `force_scrape` and `search_page_size` in addition to the existing keys.

gui/search_tab.py: Added client-side pagination. All results are fetched from the API and stored in `_all_results`; only the current page slice is shown in the table. Prev/Next buttons and a "Page X of Y (N results)" label appear between the search bar and table whenever there is more than one page. A new `set_page_size(n)` public method resets to page 1 and re-renders; called by the setup tab signal. `_load_page_size` reads `search_page_size` from meta on startup.

gui/setup_tab.py: Added "Search" group with a "Results per page" spinner (range 10–500, step 10, default 50). Saved to meta as `search_page_size`. Emits `search_page_size_changed(int)` signal on change. `_load_settings` now loads `search_page_size` and `force_scrape` from meta.

gui/main_window.py: Connected `setup_tab.search_page_size_changed` to `search_tab.set_page_size`.

[2026-05-07] — Local pages cache, scrape skip fixes, use_local_pages setting, [local]/[web] log labels

Changed

backend/scraper.py: Added `PAGES_DIR = DATA_DIR / "pages"` constant. `scrape_entry` now accepts `use_local_pages` parameter — reads `data/pages/LB-XXXXX.html` from disk when available instead of hitting the network, falling back to web only when no local file exists. When fetching from web, the HTML is saved to `data/pages/` for future reuse. Added `last_source` field (`'local'` or `'web'`) to `_scrape_state` and to the `scrape_entry` return dict. `scrape_range` accepts and threads `use_local_pages`; suppresses the inter-entry delay when `local_source=True`. `scrape_entry` attachment download now respects `use_local_pages` — existing files on disk are never re-downloaded when `use_local_pages=True`, even if `force=True`.

backend/app.py: `use_local_pages` added to `/api/db/settings` GET key list. Single-entry scrape route and `/api/scrape/start` route both read `use_local_pages` from meta and pass it through. `_start_scrape_thread` gains `use_local_pages` parameter forwarded to `scrape_range`.

gui/setup_tab.py: Added "Use local pages for metadata (data/pages/)" checkbox, saved/loaded via `use_local_pages` meta key. Scraper log now appends `[local]` or `[web]` after each "Scraped LB-X" entry using `last_source` from the status poll.

Fixed

backend/scraper.py: Scrape skip logic incorrectly re-scraped entries when `download_files=False` — any entry with `entry_files` rows (even with `downloaded=0`) was not being skipped because the pending-count check always fired. Fixed by returning `{skipped: True}` immediately when `not download_files` and the entry row exists.

backend/scraper.py: Entries with attachment files placed in `data/attachments/` from an external source were never marked `downloaded=1` in the DB, causing the scraper to repeatedly re-scrape them. Fixed by scanning the filesystem for each `downloaded=0` record and updating the DB before evaluating the pending count.

backend/scraper.py: `force=True` caused the attachment download loop to re-download files already present on disk when `use_local_pages=True`. Fixed by changing the skip condition to `local_path.exists() and (not force or use_local_pages)`.

gui/lbdir_tab.py: "Show all files" checkbox was unchecked by default, hiding pass rows and requiring a manual toggle. Changed default to checked.

gui/verify_tab.py: Same as above — "Show all files" now checked by default.

Added

backend/scraper.py: `last_source` field in `_scrape_state` (`'local'` | `'web'` | `None`) so the GUI can distinguish the metadata source per entry.

gui/setup_tab.py: "Use local pages for metadata (data/pages/)" checkbox — persisted in meta as `use_local_pages`.
